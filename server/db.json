      "directions" : "Pre heat oven to 350.  Place butter and shortening in stand mixer, beat until smooth, about 3-5 minutes.  Add 1 cup of sugar at a time, alternating between white sugar and brown sugar.  Add 1 egg at at time and mix until combined.  Add vanilla and mix well.  Add salt and baking soda, and mix well.  Add 1 cup of flour at a time.  You want the dough to be sticky but not wet.  Add as many chocolate chips that your heart desires!  Bake at 350 for 9 minutes.  You want them slightly undercooked, so you can freeze them.  Frozen cookies are the best way to eat these!"
